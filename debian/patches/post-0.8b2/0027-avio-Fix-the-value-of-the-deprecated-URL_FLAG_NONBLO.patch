Subject: [PATCH 27/67] avio: Fix the value of the deprecated
 URL_FLAG_NONBLOCK
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

This isn't used in practice anywhere within libav at the moment,
but change it for consistency until it is removed.
URL_RDONLY/WRONLY were fixed in commit 5b81e295931 (after the
values that actually were used were changed at the major bump,
in commit cbea3ac8), but this flag was unintentionally left unfixed.
